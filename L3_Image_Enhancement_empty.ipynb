You've probably heard negative stories in science news about image enhancement (see [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4210356/) review, for instance). Image enhancement can serve an important role in science, though, as it can aid human interpretation of images (for example, improving contrast or removing noise). Others can be used for pre-processing steps for quantitative methods. Finally, (for less \"scientific\" purposes) they can be used to make an image more visually appealing for, say, a journal cover. For this reason, image enhancement is a subjective in nature.\n",
